Each Episode has artwork which is thematically associated with the guest of the episode. Artwork is created by leading creatives on ùïè, and then minted on a Blockchain which best represents the guests for that Episode.

The Arbitrum Podcast, is minted on Arbitrum.

The Artwork, and the Episodes themselves are stored on Arweave.

When each episode is published, a limited edition is released just for fun.
